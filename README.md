# Anki LLM Vocabulary Add-on (Open Source EdTech)

An open-source **Education Technology (EdTech)** add-on for **Anki Desktop** that assists vocabulary flashcard creation using large language models (LLMs), while preserving **active recall** and **spaced repetition**.

You enter a word, choose a source and target language, and click **Generate**.  
The add-on fills a concise translation and a clear example sentence.  
Review and memorization are handled entirely by Anki.

## Why this add-on

The goal is **lean learning**:

- reduce friction during card creation
- keep cognitive effort during review
- avoid over-automation

The LLM is used **only at creation time**, never during review.
